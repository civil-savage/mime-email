# mime-email

More or less a fork of a project I started earlier and now want to develop further of a script that creates HTML emails.  Currently, adjusting the script to be more general purpose (see prototype for original specifications)

Purpose
-------
This script t will take a plain text file, and HTML file, and any number of images and create a valid MIME email that can be sent.
